# Battleship
Battleship console game in Java for class project

This game was created to run a game in console for Battleship using object oriented programming in Java. There were several requirementsfor this project. We were only allowed to use a driver program named Battleship and two classes named ActionGame and Gameboard. This game prompts the player to input coordinates to a grid layout and try to hit the ships on the gameboard that were automatically generated. It will tell you if there is a hit or miss and keep track of your hits and misses and total number of missiles left. The player has a choice of three gameboard sizes that each have a different amount of missles to hit five different sized ships. The hits are kept track of and displayed on the gameboard during play. I have the game working except I did not get all the requirements of this project done in time but I still got enough to pass with a 'B' for this one. I have not done anything with this code since I turned it in. 

This is a project I would like to delevop more and finish in the future.
